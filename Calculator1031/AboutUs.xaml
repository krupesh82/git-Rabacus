				<Label x:Name="answer01" Text="1031 tax deferred exchanges allow real estate investors to defer capital gain taxes on the sale of a property held for productive use in trade or business or for investment.  This tax savings provides many benefits including the obvious – 100% preservation of equity. Investors can take advantage of exchanges to meet other objectives including: A ) Leverage: exchanging from a high equity position or “free and clear” property into a much larger property with some financing in order to increase their return on investment.  B) Diversification: Such as exchanging into other geographical regions or diversifying by property type such as exchanging from several residential units into a retail strip center.  C) Management Relief: for example, exchanging out of multiple relinquished properties into either a replacement property like an apartment complex with an on-site manager or a tenant-in-common ownership program."

One of the most important is researching specific security measures they provide for the exchange proceeds held in their possession during the exchange period.  This is crucial because there is no entity at the Federal level that oversees or regulates Qualified Intermediaries and how the proceeds are invested and kept safe for investors.  In addition, find out the experience of the company, how many exchanges and the knowledge level of their staff and diversity of experience."

An exchanger has a maximum of 180 calendar days, or their tax filing date, whichever is earlier, to complete their exchange.  This is called the “exchange period”.  In addition, the exchanger must identify their potential replacement property or properties by midnight of the 45th day after closing on the sale of their relinquished property.  This is called the “identification period” and the 45 days are inclusive within the 180 day exchange period."

				<Label x:Name="answer06" Text="A 1031 exchange allows an investor to defer paying all of the capital gain taxes, which essentially equates to a long-term and interest-free loan from the Internal Revenue Service.  Since the investor who exchanges has all of their gross net equity available to reinvest, using leverage, they can acquire significantly more investment real estate that if they sold, paid all the capital gain taxes and then purchased a new a property.  The real advantage of a 1031 exchange is not just the tax savings – it is the tremendous increase in purchasing power generated by this tax savings!"
